🧾 About the Project
Kannada Vaachaka is a real-time sign language translator designed to bridge communication gaps for individuals with hearing and speech impairments, especially within Kannada-speaking communities.

The system uses an ESP32 development board to collect gesture data from a PAJ7620 gesture recognition sensor, and processes it on a laptop using OpenCV and MediaPipe for camera-based hand gesture recognition. The project features dual gesture input modes (sensor + vision), offering double verification for enhanced accuracy.

Recognized gestures are translated into Kannada speech output through pre-recorded audio files using Pygame, making communication more inclusive and intuitive.

🔍 Key Features
Real-time gesture recognition using both PAJ7620 and laptop webcam

Kannada speech output powered by Pygame

MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and classification

Uses laptop as the main processor (instead of Raspberry Pi)

Cost-effective and regionally focused for Kannada users

🎯 Goal
To build an affordable, accessible, and regionally adapted sign language translation tool that helps Kannada-speaking individuals with hearing and speech impairments communicate easily and independently.
